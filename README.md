A highly opinionated React component and boilterplate generator script. Focuses on seperation of concerns.

Creates a React component folder with the following:

- index
- Typescript types
- Storybook stories
- Styled Components styles
- React Testing Library + Jest tests

Do not install, there is nothing to install.

Create your boilerplate using npx in the folder you want the new component folder to appear:

```
# with no props
npx horc BoringComponent

# with starter props
npx horc FruitComponent apple banana cherry
```
